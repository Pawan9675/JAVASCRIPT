/**
 * üìå `let` in Block (Block Scope)
 * -------------------------------------
 * - **`let`** is **block-scoped**, meaning the variable is only available inside the block `{}` where it's defined.
 * - Trying to access the variable before it's declared results in a **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**, causing an error.
 * - This behavior is also called **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**, which prevents the variable from being accessed before it is initialized.
 * - `let` is useful when you want to limit a variable's visibility to just a block (like inside loops or conditionals).
 */

/**

/**
 * Explanation:

 *    - Variables declared with `let` and `const` are hoisted but remain uninitialized until their declaration is reached.
 *    - Trying to access them before the initialization results in an error.
 *    - This is what we call the **Temporal Dead Zone**.
 * 2Ô∏è‚É£ The variable `content` is hoisted to the top of the `fun()` function but is in the TDZ until it's initialized.
 * 3Ô∏è‚É£ Inside the `if` block, `hours` is declared with `let`, so it's only accessible within the block.
 *    - Attempting to access it outside the block will throw a **ReferenceError**.

/**
 * üìå Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript
 * -------------------------------------
 * **TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)** refers to the period between the entering of the scope and the actual declaration of a `let` or `const` variable.
 * During this time, the variable cannot be accessed.
 * 
 * The reason for this behavior is that JavaScript **hoists** variables, meaning it moves them to the top of their scope.
 * However, unlike `var`, `let` and `const` are not initialized until their declaration line is reached.
 * If you try to access them before that, you'll get a **ReferenceError**.
 * 
 * This helps avoid bugs that arise when trying to access variables before they are initialized.

 * 3Ô∏è‚É£ The error occurs because we tried to access `myVariable` before the line where it is actually initialized.

/**
 * üìå `var` in Block (Function Scope)
 * -------------------------------------
 * - Unlike `let`, **`var`** is not block-scoped. It is either **function-scoped** or **globally scoped** if declared outside any function.
 * - Even if declared inside a block, the `var` variable behaves as if it were declared in the enclosing function, not the block.
 * - **`var`** can be problematic in large code due to this behavior.

 * 2Ô∏è‚É£ If we had used `let` instead of `var`, `x` would have been **block-scoped** and not accessible outside the loop.

/**

console.log(y);  // Logs: 10, because `y` is globally scoped and accessible after the loop finishes

/**
 * Explanation:
 * 1Ô∏è‚É£ `y` is declared using `var`, so even though it is inside the `while` loop (a block), 
 *    it is **globally scoped** because it's not inside a function.
 * 2Ô∏è‚É£ The `while` loop doesn't affect the scope of `y` since `var` ignores block scoping and treats `y` as a global variable.

// *************************************************
// üìù KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS EXAMPLE
// *************************************************

/**
 * **Let in Block (Block Scope):**
 * - Variables declared with `let` inside a block are only accessible within that block.
 * - They can't be accessed before their declaration, which leads to a **ReferenceError** due to the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**.
 * 
 * **Var in Block (Function Scope):**
 * - Variables declared with `var` are not block-scoped, but function-scoped.
 * - This means a `var` declared inside a block will still be accessible outside that block if it is within a function.
 * - If declared globally, it is globally scoped and can be accessed anywhere in the program.
 */

/**
 * **Which to Use:**
 * - Use **`let`** for block-scoped variables when you want to limit the scope to a specific block.
 * - Use **`const`** for values that should not be reassigned.
 * - Avoid **`var`** unless absolutely necessary, because it can introduce unintended side effects due to its function-scoping behavior.
 */

// *************************************************
// üìå SUMMARY OF `LET` AND `VAR` IN BLOCKS
// *************************************************

/**
 * **Key Differences Between `let` and `var`:**
 * - **`let`**: Block-scoped. Variables declared with `let` are confined to the block `{}` where they are declared and cannot be accessed before their initialization (due to TDZ).
 * - **`var`**: Function-scoped. Variables declared with `var` are either function-scoped or globally scoped. They are accessible outside the block if declared inside a function or globally.
 *
 * **Which One to Use:**
 * - Prefer **`let`** or **`const`** for block scoping to avoid accidental variable leakage and improve code readability.
 * - Avoid using **`var`** unless you need function-level scoping, as it can cause unexpected behavior when used inside blocks.
